# Train_Delay_Prediction
Predicting the delay hours using machine learning algorithms and identifying the outliers
In this project i have focused on important things that covers the major part of R course:
->Data Preprocessing 
->Text preprocessing 
->Data Visualization
->Machine learning Algortithms.
Since the raw dataset was very immature so i did data preprocessing to replace the null values with the mean and did the feature scaling as well. The text preprocessing concept helped me to replace the null text with some values.
The concept of data visualization helped me to visualize my dataset under various factors.
Linear Regression helped me to predict the delay hour of trains from  their actual delay hours.
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) helped me to detect the outliers and finally i plotted a 3d model of corresponding outliers.
